define Package/swap-zram-writeback/description
 A script to activate compressed memory for a swap device. This can increase
 the total available memory by compressing the memory that is not accessed
 often (by using an algorith called LRU).

 Most programs allocate memory that they do not use after the startup.
 Allowing the system to compress that memory reduces the memory pressure as a
 trade-off for CPU cycles.

define Package/swap-zswap-cache/description
 A script to activate compressed memory cache. This compressed cache will be
 depleted before it begins to evict memory pages to a slow (real) swap device.

 This can save good amounts of I/O to the swap device at the cost of CPU cycles
 and a percentage of the memory. As compressing memory may be cheaper than
 performing I/O, the system may run smoother under memory pressure.

 If the pool is depleted and the system begins to starve, it will freeze as it
 does when swapping normally. The point of this package is to delay the point
 where it happens.
