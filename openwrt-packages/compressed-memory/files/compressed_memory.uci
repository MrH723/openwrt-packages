# Define the compression algorithms:
#  The expected ratio is what defines the capacity to save RAM, where higher
#   is better. Generally, higher compression ration leads to more latency.
#  The streams factor defines the maximum CPU cores to be used. Where 100 is
#   to use all CPUs. The lower it is, the faster that the compression algorithm
#   is, so it doesn't need to use too much CPU to do it's job. This is also
#   known as the "cost".
