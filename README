Atinout is a program that will execute AT commands in sequence and
capture the response from the modem.

Minimum example:

	$echo AT | atinout - /dev/ttyS0 -
	AT
	OK
	$

See the manual for more details on operation.

If you have not yet read the ITU V.250 specification about AT commands,
by all means go to http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-V.250-200307-I/en and
do so right away. This is a must have document when processing AT
commands.

The absolute authoritative source of information about how AT commands
behave for a given phone is the manufacturers documentation. That will
cover standardized commands (with potential divergence) as well as
proprietary commands.

The second most authoritative source of information about how AT commands
behave for a give phone is the official standard documents, e.g. V.250,
27.005, 27.007 etc.

No matter how nice random guide you have found on the web, never
threat such as an authoritative source on AT commands. Get hold of the
authoritative sources as described above and use those to check for syntax
and behavior.
